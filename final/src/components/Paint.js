import React from 'react'

        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to the Painting page</h1>
            <p>Here I'll have pictures of paintings that I've done</p>
            <p>im thinking either grid style or a single
                image feed like instagram. Maybe have an option for 
                visitors to comment on image or purchase the piece.
            </p>
        </div>
    )
